When our friends talk about you  all it does is just tear me down  Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name   It all just sounds like oooooh ooh Mmm  too young  too dumb to realize   That I should have bought you flowers And held your hand Should have gave you all my hours When I had the chance Take you to every party  Cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my baby s dancing But she s dancing with another man   My pride  my ego  my needs  and my selfish ways Caused a good  strong woman like you to walk out my life Now I ll never  never get to clean up the mess I made  oh  And it haunts me every time I close my eyes   It all just sounds like oooooh ooh Mmm  too young  too dumb to realize   That I should have bought you flowers And held your hand Should have gave you all my hours When I had the chance Take you to every party  Cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my baby s dancing But she s dancing with another man   Although it hurts I ll be the first to say that I was wrong Oh  I know I m probably much too late To try and apologize for my mistakes But I just want you to know   I hope he buys you flowers I hope he holds your hand Give you all his hours When he has the chance Take you to every party  Cause I remember how much you loved to dance Do all the things I should have done When I was your man   Do all the things I should have done When I was your man

Cause I could draw  my uncle was  and I kept my room straight I told my mom  tears rushing down my face She s like   Ben  you ve loved girls since before Pre K   Trippin   yeah I guess she had a point  didn t she  A bunch of stereotypes all in my head I remember doing the math like   Yeah  I m good at little league   A pre conceived idea of what it all meant For those that like the same sex had the characteristics The right wing conservatives think it s a decision And you can be cured with some treatment and religion Man made  rewiring of a pre disposition Playing God  aw nah  here we go America the brave still fears what we don t know And  God loves all his children  is somehow forgotten But we paraphrase a book written thirty five hundred years ago I don t know   And I can t change  even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I can t change  even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love  my love  my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm   If I was gay  I would think hip hop hates me Have you read the YouTube comments lately   Man  that s gay  gets dropped on the daily We ve become so numb to what we re sayin  Our culture founded from oppression Yet we don t have acceptance for  em Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board A word rooted in hate  yet our genre still ignores it  Gay  is synonymous with the lesser It s the same hate that s caused wars from religion Gender to skin color  the complexion of your pigment The same fight that led people to walk outs and sit ins It s human rights for everybody  there is no difference Live on and be yourself When I was at church they taught me something else If you preach hate at the service  those words aren t anointed That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen I might not be the same  but that s not important No freedom  til we re equal  damn right I support it     And I can t change  even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love  my love  my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm   We press play  don t press pause  progress  march on  With a veil over our eyes  we turn our back on the cause  Til the day that my uncles can be united by law Kids are walking  round the hallway Plagued by a pain in their heart A world so hateful  some would rather die than be who they are And a certificate on paper isn t gonna solve it all But it s a damn good place to start No law s gonna change us  we have to change us Whatever god you believe in  we come from the same one Strip away the fear  underneath it s all the same love About time that we raised up    And I can t change  even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I can t change  even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love  my love  my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm   Love is patient Love is kind Love is patient Love is kind  not crying on Sundays  Love is patient  not crying on Sundays  Love is kind  not crying on Sundays  Love is patient  not crying on Sundays  Love is kind  not crying on Sundays  Love is patient  not crying on Sundays  Love is kind  not crying on Sundays  Love is patient Love is kind  You took my heart  and you held it in your mouth And with a word all my love came rushing out And every whisper  it s the worst Emptied out by a single word There is a hollow in me now   So I put my faith in something unknown I m living on such sweet nothing But I m trying to hope with nothing to hold I m living on such sweet nothing And it s hard to learn  and it s hard to love When you re giving me such sweet nothing Sweet nothing  sweet nothing You re giving me such sweet nothing   It isn t easy for me to let it go  Cause I ve swallowed every single word And every whisper  every sigh Eats away at this heart of mine And there is a hollow in me now   So I put my faith in something unknown I m living on such sweet nothing But I m trying to hope with nothing to hold I m living on such sweet nothing And it s hard to learn  and it s hard to love When you re giving me such sweet nothing Sweet nothing  sweet nothing You re giving me such sweet nothing   And it s not enough to tell me that you care When we both know the words are empty air You give me nothing Nothing   Sweet nothing Sweet nothing I got my red dress on tonight Dancin  in the dark in the pale moonlight Done my hair up real big  beauty queen style High heels off  I m feelin  alive  Oh my God  I feel it

When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail Are the worst of all  and the blood s run stale   I wanna hide the truth  I wanna shelter you But with the beast inside  there s nowhere we can hide No matter what we breed  we still are made of greed This is my kingdom come  this is my kingdom come   When you feel my heat  look into my eyes It s where my demons hide  it s where my demons hide Don t get too close  it s dark inside It s where my demons hide  it s where my demons hide   At the curtain s call it s the last of all When the lights fade out  all the sinners crawl So they dug your grave and the masquerade Will come calling out at the mess you ve made   Don t wanna let you down  but I am hell bound Though this is all for you  don t wanna hide the truth No matter what we breed  we still are made of greed This is my kingdom come  this is my kingdom come   When you feel my heat  look into my eyes It s where my demons hide  it s where my demons hide Don t get too close  it s dark inside It s where my demons hide  it s where my demons hide   They say it s what you make  I say it s up to fate It s woven in my soul  I need to let you go Your eyes  they shine so bright  I wanna save that light I can t escape this now  unless you show me how   When you feel my heat  look into my eyes It s where my demons hide  it s where my demons hide Don t get too close  it s dark inside It s where my demons hide  it s where my demons hide  Lately  I ve been  I ve been losing sleep Dreaming about the things that we could be But baby  I ve been  I ve been praying hard Said no more

Breathing in the snowflakes Burnt lungs  sour taste Light s gone  days end Struggling to pay rent Long nights  strange men   And they say She s in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since 18 But lately  her face seems Slowly sinking  wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us    Cause we re just under the upper hand And go mad for a couple grams And she don t want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland Or sells love to another man It s too cold outside For angels to fly Angels to fly   Ripped gloves  raincoat Tried to swim and stay afloat Dry house  wet clothes Loose change  bank notes Weary eyed  dry throat Call girl  no phone   And they say She s in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since 18 But lately  her face seems Slowly sinking  wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us    Cause we re just under the upper hand And go mad for a couple grams And she don t want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland Or sells love to another man It s too cold outside For angels to fly   An angel will die Covered in white Closed eyes and hopin  for a better life This time  we ll fade out tonight Straight down the line   And they say She s in the Class A Team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since 18 But lately  her face seems Slowly sinking  wasting Crumbling like pastries And they scream The worst things in life come free to us   And we re all under the upper hand And go mad for a couple grams And we don t want to go outside tonight And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland Or sell love to another man It s too cold outside For angels to fly Angels to fly Fly  fly For angels to fly To fly  to fly For angels to die  Well I woke up to the sound of silence The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight And I found you with a bottle of wine Your head in the curtains And heart like the fourth of July You swore and said We are not We are not shining stars This I know I never said we are Though I ve never been through hell like that I ve closed enough windows To know you can never look back   If you re lost and alone Or you re sinking like a stone Carry on May your past be the sound Of your feet upon the ground Carry on Carry on  carry on   So I met up with some friends At the edge of the night At a bar off 75 And we talked and talked About how our parents will die All our neighbors and wives But I d like to think I can cheat it all To make up for the times I ve been cheated on And it s nice to know When I was left for dead I was found and now I don t roam these streets I am not the ghost you want of me   If you re lost and alone Or you re sinking like a stone Carry on May your past be the sound Of your feet upon the ground and Carry on   Woah My head is on fire But my legs are fine After all they are mine Lay your clothes down on the floor Close the door Hold the phone Show me how No one s ever gonna stop us now     Cause we are We are shining stars We are invincible We are who we are On our darkest day When we re miles away So we ll come We will find our way home   If you re lost and alone Or you re sinking like a stone Carry on May your past be the sound Of your feet upon the ground and Carry on   No one s ever gonna stop us now The 100 best

You can be the outcast Or be the backlash of somebody s lack of love Or you can start speaking up Nothing s gonna hurt you the way that words do When they settle  neath your skin Kept on the inside and no sunlight Sometimes a shadow wins But I wonder what would happen if you   Say what you wanna say And let the words fall out Honestly  I wanna see you be brave With what you want to say And let the words fall out Honestly  I wanna see you be brave   I just wanna see you I just wanna see you I just wanna see you I wanna see you be brave I just wanna see you I just wanna see you I just wanna

you love her when you let her go And you let her go      Staring at the bottom of your glass Hoping one day you ll make a dream last But dreams come slow and they go so fast You see her when you close your eyes Maybe one day you ll understand why Everything you touch surely dies   But you only need the light when it s burning low Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know you ve been high when you re feeling low Only hate the road when you re missing home Only know you love her when you let her go   Staring at the ceiling in the dark Same old empty feeling in your heart  Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast Well you see her when you fall asleep But never to touch and never to keep  Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep   Well you only need the light when it s burning low Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know you ve been high when you re feeling low Only hate the road when you re missing home Only know you love her when you let her go And you let her go      Oh  oh  woah  oh  oh And you let her go Oh  oh  woah  oh  oh When you let her go Whoa    Cause you only need the light when it s burning low Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know you ve been high when you re feeling low Only hate the road when you re missing home Only know you love her when you let her go  Cause you only need the light when it s burning low Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know you ve been high when you re feeling low Only hate the road when you re missing home Only know you love her when you let her go And you let her go     Don t you worry  bout gettin  fixed up When

stay the same the more that they seem to change Dont ya think its strange Girl put your records on tell me your favorite song You go ahead let your hair down Sapphire and faded jeans I hope you get your dreams Just go ahead let your hair down Youre gonna find yourself somewhere somehow Just more than I could take pity for pitys sake Some nights kept me awake I thought that I was stronger When you gonna realize that you dont even have to try any longer Do what you want to Girl put your records on tell me your favorite song Just go ahead let your hair down Sapphire and faded jeans I hope you get your dreams Just go ahead let your hair down Youre gonna find yourself somewhere somehow   When Im away from you Im happier than ever Wish I could explain it better I wish it wasnt true Give me a day or two to think of something clever To write myself a letter To tell me what to do mmmm Do you read my interviews Or do you skip my avenue When you said you were passin through Was I even on your way I knew when I asked you to When I asked you to Be cool about what I was tellin you Youd do the opposite of what you said youd do What you said youd do And Id end up more afraid Dont say it isnt fair You clearly wer nt aware that you made me mis rable So if you really wanna know When Im away from you When Im away from you Im happier than ever Happier than ever Wish I could explain it better Wish I could explain it better I wish it wasnt true mmmm You call me again drunk in your Benz Drivin home under the influence You scared me to death but Im wastin my breath Cause you only listen to

there  on a sunny morning Little Jimmy Brown was born  All the chapel bells were ringing In the little valley town And the song that they were singing Was for baby Jimmy Brown  Then the little congregation Prayed for guidance from above  Lead us not into temptation Bless this hour of meditation Guide him with eternal love    There s a village  hidden deep in the valley Beneath the mountains high above And there  twenty years thereafter Jimmy was to meet his love  All the chapel bells were ringing  Twas a great day in his life Cause the song that they were singing Was for Jimmy and his wife  Then the little congregation Prayed for guidance from above  Lead us not into temptation Bless  O Lord  this celebration May their lives be filled with love    From the village  hidden deep in the valley One rainy morning dark and gray A soul winged its way to Heaven Jimmy Brown had passed away  Just one lonely bell was ringing In the little valley town  Twas farewell that it was singing To our dear old Jimmy Brown  And the little congregation Prayed for guidance from above  Lead us not into temptation May his soul find the salvation Of thy great eternal love   Doo dooby doo Dum dum  dum

singer to sell  What s the man he s introducing done with all that hard work   Man that sang   I Go CRAZY    The snare smacks  as the  horn  section blares a G chord  It s  really  I ll   Go   Crazy    but Gonder s  determined  to out country JB s  enunciation     Try   ME   G sharp   YOU ve Got  the  Power   A   THINK   A sharp   If You  Want Me    B   except  oh  dear   problem in  the trumpet section  either Teddy Washington or  Mack Johnson hits a bad note    What was this  If You Want Me     Not a  hit   really it had  been  the  flip side   of  Bewildered   What was it doing in the  list of hits  It sounded good     I Don t Mind   C   Be WIL dered   C sharp   At  this  point  there s what  sounds like  the first  bit we ve  lost from  the  tape   just a tiny  dropout  but  perhaps  there  was  something edited out  there    Million dolla sella  LOST Someone    Not  just a million seller  mind you  but a million dollar seller  at a time when a single usually cost 79 cents   Lost Someone  had been  a No  2 R B hit   but  given  that  it only got  up to No   48 on  the  pop  charts   that  particular distinction is unlikely  The  band hits a D   The very latest  release   NIGHT Train    Well  no    Shout and Shimmy  and  Mashed Potatoes U S A   had come out since  Night Train    but it had  been his biggest hit  that  year  D sharp    It s  everybody   Shout and SHIMMY    We ll be hearing  more about  that in a minute  E  GOLD Brown has perhaps a dozen  gold  records to his credit   the little unbylined puff piece in that week s New York Amsterdam News announced  That was pushing it   he d only had 15 chart  singles by that  point  James  Brown didn t  have a certified gold single until 1972 s  Get  On the Good  Foot   although King evidently didn t  bother with RIAA gold and platinum  certification  Still  for an Apollo audience  Gonder had a lot of familiar song titles to mention   There are an awful lot of citations of chart numbers and dates in this book  Live with them  They are an essential  part of James  Brown s  art   His  genius is the genius of rolls of tickets tom  off one by one  of money handed  over  for  records   of the hit  The great James Brown  songs  are  popular   the  popular  James  Brown songs are great  As George W S  Trow wrote in another  darker  context   It s  a Hit  Love it  It s a Hit   It loves you because you love it because it s a Hit    You come to see my show   Brown sang   That s why James Brown loves you  so    This is a hit    he  declared as the  tape rolled  for  Papa s Got a Brand  New  Bag   he cut it out of the released  record  but persuaded some  of the other artists  whose  records he produced around that  time  to yell  the  same  thing  so  it  might work  its  magic  for them  too   Look  at his singles  discography  and  ignore the  instrumentals  the duets   the reissues   the  throwaways on King s subsidiary label  Bethlehem  the  Christmas and novelty records just concentrate on the songs he threw his weight  behind  A pattern emerges  or rather an unbroken block   between  Money Won t  Change You  in July  1966  and   Hot  I Need  To Be Loved  Loved  Loved   Loved   nine years later  James Brown had over sixty consecutive chart  hits  On  his own terms  he was an unstoppable champion  and  those  terms  were  people paying  to hear  him sing  and being  reassured that  what they  were  paying  for  was popular   That s why he wanted  to make Live at the Apollo so badly   he  could  demonstrate that  being  James Brown was itself a hit   All he had  to do was get it on  tape  THE CATALOGUE OF  HITSBack at  the  Apollo   Gonder s speech  has  been  setting up a couple  of subliminal effects  Starting with  You ve Got  the  Power    and  running  through   Bewildered   there s  a steady 6 8 rhythm to the words he accents and the band s stabs   a tick tock swing that s at pretty much the  same  tempo  as  Brown s  ballads   There s also a hidden message in those emphases Crazy Me  You Think Want Mind Be WILL Lost Night Shimmy  This  is a night  for  total  abandon   the suggestion goes  for thoughts  to become desires and then to simple be  through  sheer will  a night to be lost to shimmying    A young man named Danny Ray was waiting in the wings  He d  just been hired  that week  as James Brown s valet  a few years later   he d  take over the emcee  job  which he still holds today  and his introductions to the James  Brown show  have been  patterned  on  Gonder s ever since    Gonder s still going   Mr   Dynamite  Mr  Dynamite  had been the title of two movies  one from 1935  adapted from Dashiell Hammett s story  On the Make   and  the  other   from  1941   starring   Lloyd  Nolan   as Tommy N  Thornton  nice initials   the amazing Mr  Please  Please himself  the star of the show  as if there could be any doubt  as Gonder is almost erupting with conviction  JAMES BROWN AND  the  FAMOUS FLAMES   THE SCRATCHThe horns buck  one  two  three  four  five  all on a G chord that s climbed  up an octave since Gonder started his litany   It s  the  beginning of a fanfare  to announce the  Hardest Working Man  In Show  Business s  arrival  three  choruses of a perky  little  blues  riff  Brown  glides onto  stage  during the  third  and  probably does  some high powered   footwork   judging    by   the    screams  Twenty nine years old and as flexible as a piece of yarn  he  can  dance  faster  and  harder than  anyone  rippling his body   floating over  a wooden floor  as if it s  water slicked  ice   The perky  little  blues  riff has  a name   although it was never  credited on  any  edition of Live at the Apollo until 2004  it s   The  Scratch   Brown   and  his  band  including Les Buie on guitar  and Hubert Perry on bass  still with  the  band  at the  Apollo  had  recorded it as an instrumental on October 4  1960    The Scratch  is also a close cousin of Henry Mancini s  Peter Gunn  theme  which  had  been  a hit for  Ray Anthony in 1959   Duane Eddy s version  charted for  the  first  time  on  October 10   1960    Brown s version  appeared as the  B side  of  Hold It   in January 1961   and  the  band  played  it  as his entrance music  at least  through mid 1963   As the band bats down the last note again and again  you can almost see James Brown s feet slide frictionlessly into position behind the microphone  I LL GO CRAZYJames Brown steps up to the front  of the Apollo stage  gazes out over 1500 thoroughly warmed up faces  and assesses matters  with a huge  holler   He  feels all right  and he wants to make sure everybody knows it  The third time he announces  it  he gives the  all  an enormous melismatic rush  swooping around  at least twelve notes just to prove he can  then  as he takes a breath  guitarist Les Buie whacks sharply at his strings   and we re into  I ll  Go  Crazy   THE MISSING SONGExcept we re  not  there s  almost certainly  at least one song missing from the set on Live at the Apollo  In those days  JB usually opened  his shows with his latest hit  In October  1962   that  was  Shout  and Shimmy    which had made No  16 on the R B chart  No  61 pop  back in August  Recorded  February  9  1961  the same day as  Lost  Someone   and  Night Train    it starts with the I feel all right routine  and then proceeds to a truly shameless ripoff of the Isley Brothers  1959 hit  Shout     Really   truly  shameless  The  I feel all right  business  is derived  from  the  beginning of the  second half of the Isleys  record  and the rest of the record is basically the  fast  parts  of  Shout   with  the  gospel  inflections removed and  the  word   shimmy  added   It wasn t  the last  time JB  would  appropriate the  Isleys   work  as his own  either   It s My Thing   his protegee Marva Whitney s  1969  single   credited to J  Brown M  Whitney  could  be charitably described as an answer  song  to the Isleys    It s Your  Thing   It  could   be  less  charitably described as a cover  that  changes the  pronouns         Alright you Chipmunks  Ready to sing your song   I d say we are  Yeah  Lets

town called Casino  The Next morning being Sunday  several of the boys went to Church  A sergeant Commanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer The text was taken up next  Those of the boys who had a prayer book took Them out  but this one boy had only a deck of cards  and so he spread Them out  The Sergeant saw the cards and said   Soldier  put away those Cards   After the services was over  the soldier was taken prisoner and Brought before the Provost Marshall  The Marshall said   Sergeant  why have you brought this man Here    For playing cards in church  Sir    And what have you to say for Yourself  son    Much  Sir   replied the soldier  The Marshall said   I Hope so  for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever Punished   The soldier said   Sir  I have been on the march for about six Days  I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book  but I hope to satisfy You  Sir  with the purity of my intentions   And with that  the boy Started his story    You see Sir  when I look at the Ace  it reminds me that there Is but one God  And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into Two parts  the Old and the New Testaments  When I see the Trey  I think Of the Father  the Son  and the Holy Ghost  And when I see the Four  I Think of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel  there was Matthew  Mark  Luke and John  And when I see the Five  it reminds me of the five Wise virgins who trimmed their lamps  there were ten of them  five were Wise and were saved  five were foolish and were shut out  When I see the Six  it reminds me that in six days  God made this great heaven and Earth  When I see the Seven  it reminds me that on the seventh day  God Rested from His great work  And when I see the Eight  I think of the Eight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth  there was Noah  his wife  their sons and their wives  And when I see the Nine  I Think of the lepers our Savior cleansed  and nine out of the ten didn t Even thank Him  When I see the Ten  I think of the Ten Commandments God Handed down to Moses on a table of stone  When I see the King  it Reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven  God Almighty  And when I See the Queen  I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary  who is Queen of Heaven  And the Jack or Knave is the Devil  When I count the number Of spots on a deck of cards  I find 365  the number of days in a year There are 52 cards  the number of weeks in a year  There are 4 suits  the Number of weeks in a month  There are 12 picture cards  the number of Months in a year  There are 13 tricks  the number of weeks in a quarter So you see  Sir  my pack of cards serves me as a Bible  an Almanac and a Prayer Book     And friends  the story is true  I know  I was that soldier   Does she love me  with all her heart Should I worry  when we re apart It s a lover s question  I d like to know  Does she need me  as she pretends Is this a game  well then will I win It s a lover s question  I d like to know  I d like to know when she s not with me If she s still true to me I d like to know when we re kissing Does she feel just what I feel And how am I to know it s really real  Oh  tell me where  the answer lies Is it in her kiss or in her eyes It s a lover s question I d like to know  I d like to know when she s not with me If she s still true to me I d like to know when we re kissing Does she feel just what I feel And how am I to know it s really real  Oh  tell me where  the answer lies Is it in her kiss or in her eyes It s a lover s question I d like to know My love must be a kind of

turned bad  Take a message to Mary But don t tell her where I am Take a message to Mary But don t say I m in a jam You can tell her I had to see the world Or tell her that my ship set sail You can say she better not wait for me But don t tell her I m in jail Oh  don t tell her I m in jail  Take a message to Mary But don t tell her what I ve done Please don t mention the stagecoach And the shot from a careless gun You can tell her I had to change my plans And cancel out the wedding day But please don t mention my lonely cell Where I m gonna pine away Until my dying day  Take a message to Mary But don t tell her all you know My heart s aching for Mary Lord knows I miss her so Just tell her I went to Timbuktu Tell her I m searching for gold You can say she better find someone new To cherish and to hold Oh  Lord  this cell is cold  Mary  Mary Oh  Lord this cell is cold Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored He has loosed the fateful lightening of His terrible swift sword His truth is marching on  CHORUS  Glory  Glory  Hallelujah  Glory  Glory  Hallelujah  Glory  Glory  Hallelujah  His truth is marching on  I have seen Him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps His day is marching on  CHORUS  I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnish d rows of steel   As ye deal with my condemners  So with you my grace shall deal   Let the Hero  born of woman  crush the serpent with his heel Since God is marching on  CHORUS  He has sounded form the trumpet that shall never call retreat He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat Oh  be swift  my soul  to answer Him  be jubilant  my feet  Our God is marching on  CHORUS  In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me  As He died to make men holy  let us die to make men free While God is marching on  CHORUS Dee doodee doom doom      Seven little girls Sitting in the backseat Hugging and a kissing with Fred I said  why don t one of you Come and sit beside me And this is what the seven girls said   CHORUS  All together now  one  two  three Keep your mind on your driving Keep your hands on the wheel Keep your snoopy eyes on the road
